# House Robber II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are  **arranged in a circle.**  That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and  **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return  *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight  **without alerting the police***.

 

Original
C++
 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

class Solution {
public:
    int helper(vector<int>& nums, int st, int end) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> dp(n - 1);
        dp[0] = nums[st];
        dp[1] = max(nums[st], nums[st + 1]);
        for (int i = st + 2, j = 2; i <= end; i++, j++) {
            dp[j] = max(dp[j - 1], dp[j - 2] + nums[i]);
        }
        return dp[n - 2];
    }
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 1)
            return nums[0];
        if (n == 2)
            return max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        return max(helper(nums, 0, n - 2), helper(nums, 1, n - 1));
    }
};
```
